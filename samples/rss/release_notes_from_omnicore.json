The new fields <code>receivers</code>, which provides a list for every receiver, and <code>totalamount</code> are most relevant for this transaction. See the examples below.</li>\n<li>The change output of Omni transactions is no longer random, but added to the end of the transaction.

Testing on testnet and regtest mode is available from the start.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send send-to-many transactions</li>\n<li>Construct payloads for send-to-many transactions</li>\n<li>Parse and retrieve data of send-to-many transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What's new?</strong></p>\n<p>A new transaction type 7 is introduced to transfer multiple tokens of one property id to multiple receivers. <a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/send-to-many.md\">Check out this link for a more detailed view.</a></p>\n<p>Two new RPCs were added to facilitate the new feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_sendtomany\">omni_sendtomany</a> to send send-to-many transactions via the user's wallet.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_createpayload_sendtomany\">omni_createpayload_sendtomany</a> to construct the plain payload. Note however, the rest of the transaction, in particular actually adding outputs for each receiver is still necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What else is affected?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_gettransaction\">omni_gettransaction</a> can be used to retrieve information about send-to- many transactions. The new fields <code>receivers</code>, which provides a list for every receiver, and <code>totalamount</code> are most relevant for this transaction. See the examples below.</li>\n<li>The change output of Omni transactions is no longer random, but added to the end of the transaction. This affects all Omni transactions generated by this version of Omni Core.</li>\n<li>The transaction history window of the Qt client properly shows send-to-many transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n<p>You are a low level developer and want to manually craft transactions, then you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#raw-transactions\">raw transaction interface</a> of Omni Core. To construct the payload for a send-to-many transaction:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>omni_createpayload_sendtomany 31 '[{\"output\": 2, \"amount\": \"10.5\"}, {\"output\": 3, \"amount\": \"0.5\"}, {\"output\": 5, \"amount\":

transaction, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/develop/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_gettransaction\">omni_gettransaction</a>, which has the new fields

Wait until it has completely shut down, then copy the new version of <code>omnicored</code>, <code>omnicore-cli</code> and <code>omnicore-qt</code>. On Microsoft Windows the setup routine can be used to automate these steps.</p>\n<p>When upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0, the database of Omni Core is reconstructed, which can easily consume several hours. During the first startup historical Omni Layer transactions are reprocessed and Omni Core will not be usable for several hours up to more than a day. The progress of the initial scan is reported on the console, the GUI and written to the <code>debug.log</code>. The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.</p>\n<p>Upgrading from 0.8.1 or 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.</p>\n<h2>Downgrading</h2>\n<p>Downgrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with Bitcoin Core</h2>\n<p>Omni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.</p>\n<p>However, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.</p>\n<h1>Improvements</h1>\n<h2>Use wrapped Segrated Witness scripts for new addresses</h2>\n<p>When using <code>getnewaddress</code> new addresses are generated with Segrated Witness scripts wrapped in P2SH. On mainnet, those addresses start with a <code>3</code> instead of <code>1</code>. This upgrade lowers transaction fees significantly and should not break integrations.</p>\n<p>In case you need to fall back to the legacy address generation, please start Omni Core with <code>addresstype=legacy</code> configuration option.</p>\n<h2>New transactions to anchor arbitrary data</h2>\n<p>Two new transaction types were added to anchor arbitrary data on-chain. This allows the creation of overlay protocols on top of the Omni protocol, or can simply be used to store any form of data in the blockchain.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of sending and pulling data</strong></p>\n<p>Sending the hex-encoded data <code>497420776f726b7321</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre>$ omnicore-cli <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>omni_sendanydata<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>2N5bnBsaVdPBuK5xKCQ5ZTXnofBfwSxU2Th<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>497420776f726b7321<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>4c9776f28e7015e840a05cb0955c22fd6917cf264032ad694e5d1ee0d8ebf745\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>After a confirmation:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre>$ omnicore-cli <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>omni_gettransaction<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>4c9776f28e7015e840a05cb0955c22fd6917cf264032ad694e5d1ee0d8ebf745<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"txid\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">\"4c9776f28e7015e840a05cb0955c22fd6917cf264032ad694e5d1ee0d8ebf745\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"fee\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">\"0.00003240\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"sendingaddress\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">\"2N5bnBsaVdPBuK5xKCQ5ZTXnofBfwSxU2Th\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"ismine\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">0</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"type_int\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">200</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"type\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">\"Embed any data\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"data\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">\"497420776f726b7321\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"valid\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"blockhash\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">\"7c1e8be2c48fa6062b2b8ff6de7b2e1bc14b7d281d961979ed195a86399abd75\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"blocktime\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">1599469254</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"positioninblock\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"block\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">367</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s\">\"confirmations\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p>For more details, please see the descriptions of the new RPCs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_sendanydata\">omni_sendanydata</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_createpayload_anydata\">omni_createpayload_anydata</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Experimental querying of any Bitcoin balance</h2>\n<p>A new optional database was added, which allows the user to query any Bitcoin balance or list transactions of any addresses. Please note, this feature is experimental and not enabled per default. To enable the new database, restart Omni Core with <code>experimental-btc-balances=1</code> configuration option.</p>\n<p><strong>When enabling this option, Omni Core creates a new database for Bitcoin balances. This step can take a very long time of up to multiple days on mainnet.

OmniJ related tests were upgraded to use JDK 11. New tests for funded transactions were added and old bash tests were converted to the newer functional test framework. Additional checks and safe guards were implemented.</p>\n<p>These changes improve the robustness and reliability of Omni Core.</p>\n<h1>Change log</h1>\n<p>The following list includes relevant pull requests merged into this release:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>- #1142 Remove OpenSSL usage from Omni source\n- #1146 Travis OmniJ tests: upgrade to JDK 11 (from JDK 8)\n- #1153 Check Omni token balance is consistent after reorg\n- #1155 Add tests for CreateFundedTransaction\n- #1159 Convert bash test scripts to functional test framework\n- #1163 Set default address type to P2SH_SEGWIT\n- #1166 Add new transaction type to embed any data\n- #1168 Support adding a receiver address for \"any data\" transactions\n- #1169 Avoid overflow on reindex with debug enabled\n- #1165 Add bitcore indexing\n- #1173 Bump version to 0.9.0\n- #1175 Add description for -experimental-btc-balances\n- #1179 Move lock to blockOnchainActive\n- #1177 Add documentation for address index RPCs\n- #1181 Return error, when using bitcore RPCs without addrindex\n- #1176 Add release notes for Omni Core 0.9.0\n</code></pre></div>\n<h1>Credits</h1>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, especially to Peter Bushnell.</p>",

The progress of the initial scan is reported on the console, the GUI and written to the <code>debug.log</code>. The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.</p>\n<p>Upgrading from 0.8.1 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.</p>\n<h2>Downgrading</h2>\n<p>Downgrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with Bitcoin Core</h2>\n<p>Omni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.</p>\n<p>However, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.</p>\n<h1>Improvements</h1>\n<h2>New RPCs for the distributed exchange</h2>\n<p>Three new RPCs were added to

The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.</p>\n<p>Upgrading from 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.</p>\n<h2>Downgrading</h2>\n<p>Downgrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with Bitcoin Core</h2>\n<p>Omni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.</p>\n<p>However, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.</p>\n<h1>Imported notes</h1>\n<h2>Performance improvements</h2>\n<p>Due to persistence optimizations the initial time to synchronize a new Omni Core node, upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0 or rebuilding Omni Core's database with the <code>-startclean</code> startup option is significantly improved.</p>\n<p>In our tests, the time to build the internal database of Omni Core was reduced by a factor up to 4x.</p>\n<h2>Transaction replays</h2>\n<p>An issue has been discovered that affects all 0.6 and higher versions of Omni Core.</p>\n<p>The result of this issue is that some transactions may be executed twice. The effect is that tokens will be credited and debited more than once, leaving some token balances lower or higher than they should be. No new money can be created with this issue.</p>\n<p>This problem goes back to an update of Omni Core 0.6 in August 2019 and since then, while not necessarily exclusive, transactions of the following blocks may have been executed twice:</p>\n<p><code>619141</code>, <code>618465</code>, <code>614732</code>, <code>599587</code>, <code>591848</code>, <code>589999</code>, <code>578141</code></p>\n<p>The first startup of the 0.8.0 release will trigger a full reparse of all blocks, after which balances will be restored to their correct state. This will remove additional tokens credited by this error and any transactions which include them. This step can take several hours or more than a day.</p>\n<h2>Searching for affected transactions</h2>\n<p>To exchanges, wallet operators, and any integrators who use another database on top of Omni Core to track transactions or balances, we can suggest the following options for checking the validity of your transaction history. Each of the following options have different time or technical requirements and produce varying levels of details.</p>\n<p>Neither option is required, if you solely use Omni Core to track balances and transaction histories, as after the first start of Omni Core 0.8.0, it's internal state is correct.</p>\n<h3>Option 1:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Time Commitment: Least</li>\n<li>Technical Commitment: Least</li>\n<li>Details: Least</li>\n<li>Reliability: fair</li>\n<li>Steps:\n<ul>\n<li>Before shutting down your existing node:</li>\n<li>Pause all incoming/outgoing transactions for your hot/cold wallets</li>\n<li>Run <code>omnicore-cli omni_getallbalancesforaddress &lt;hot/cold wallet address&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Record the balances for the addresses</li>\n<li>Stop your client, upgrade to 0.8 according to the upgrade instructions of this release, relaunch and let synchronize and reparse</li>\n<li>After synchronization and reparse is complete rerun the <code>omni_getallbalancesforaddress</code> command and compare the balances reported to the previously saved balances. (Optionally, during the parse you can also compare the saved balances to balances reported on omniexplorer.info)</li>\n<li>If balances match before and after you are most likely not affected (see footnote below)</li>\n<li>If you notice a discrepancy it is advised you proceed with verification via Option 2 below</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Footnote: If your hot wallet utilizes the send all transaction type for sweeping this method may produce a false favorable result.

Wait until it has completely shut down, then copy the new version of <code>omnicored</code>, <code>omnicore-cli</code> and <code>omnicore-qt</code>. On Microsoft Windows the setup routine can be used to automate these steps.</p>\n<p>When upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0, the database of Omni Core is reconstructed, which can easily consume several hours. During the first startup historical Omni Layer transactions are reprocessed and Omni Core will not be usable for several hours up to more than a day. The progress of the initial scan is reported on the console, the GUI and written to the <code>debug.log</code>. The scan may be interrupted and can be resumed.</p>\n<p>Upgrading from 0.8.0 does not require a rescan and can be done very fast without interruption.</p>\n<h2>Downgrading</h2>\n<p>Downgrading to an Omni Core version prior to 0.8.0 is not supported.</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with Bitcoin Core</h2>\n<p>Omni Core is based on Bitcoin Core 0.18.1 and can be used as replacement for Bitcoin Core. Switching between Omni Core and Bitcoin Core may be supported.</p>\n<p>However, it is not advised to upgrade or downgrade to versions other than Bitcoin Core 0.18. When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.</p>\n<h1>Imported notes</h1>\n<h2>Performance improvements</h2>\n<p>Due to persistence optimizations the initial time to synchronize a new Omni Core node, upgrading from an older version than 0.8.0 or rebuilding Omni Core's database with the <code>-startclean</code> startup option is significantly improved.</p>\n<p>In our tests, the time to build the internal database of Omni Core was reduced by a factor up to 4x.</p>\n<h2>Transaction replays</h2>\n<p>An issue has been discovered that affects all 0.6 and higher versions of Omni Core.</p>\n<p>The result of this issue is that some transactions may be executed twice. The effect is that tokens will be credited and debited more than once, leaving some token balances lower or higher than they should be. No new money can be created with this issue.</p>\n<p>This problem goes back to an update of Omni Core 0.6 in August 2019 and since then, while not necessarily exclusive, transactions of the following blocks may have been executed twice:</p>\n<p><code>619141</code>, <code>618465</code>, <code>614732</code>, <code>599587</code>, <code>591848</code>, <code>589999</code>, <code>578141</code></p>\n<p>The first startup of the 0.8.0 release will trigger a full reparse of all blocks, after which balances will be restored to their correct state. This will remove additional tokens credited by this error and any transactions which include them. This step can take several hours or more than a day.</p>\n<h2>Searching for affected transactions</h2>\n<p>To exchanges, wallet operators, and any integrators who use another database on top of Omni Core to track transactions or balances, we can suggest the following options for checking the validity of your transaction history. Each of the following options have different time or technical requirements and produce varying levels of details.</p>\n<p>Neither option is required, if you solely use Omni Core to track balances and transaction histories, as after the first start of Omni Core 0.8.0, it's internal state is correct.</p>\n<h3>Option 1:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Time Commitment: Least</li>\n<li>Technical Commitment: Least</li>\n<li>Details: Least</li>\n<li>Reliability: fair</li>\n<li>Steps:\n<ul>\n<li>Before shutting down your existing node:</li>\n<li>Pause all incoming/outgoing transactions for your hot/cold wallets</li>\n<li>Run <code>omnicore-cli omni_getallbalancesforaddress &lt;hot/cold wallet address&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Record the balances for the addresses</li>\n<li>Stop your client, upgrade to 0.8 according to the upgrade instructions of this release, relaunch and let synchronize and reparse</li>\n<li>After synchronization and reparse is complete rerun the <code>omni_getallbalancesforaddress</code> command and compare the balances reported to the previously saved balances.

Each field in the RPC<br />\nhas been moved to another commands output with that command also giving<br />\nadditional information that <code>getinfo</code> did not provide.

This allows for longer targets and means estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.</li>\n<li>Estimates can now be <em>conservative</em> or <em>economical</em>. <em>Conservative</em> estimates use longer time horizons to produce an estimate which is less susceptible to rapid changes in fee conditions. <em>Economical</em> estimates use shorter time horizons and will be more affected by short-term changes in fee conditions. Economical estimates may be considerably lower during periods of low transaction activity (for example over weekends), but may result in transactions being unconfirmed if prevailing fees increase rapidly.</li>\n<li>By default, the wallet will use conservative fee estimates to increase the reliability of transactions being confirmed within the desired target. For transactions that are marked as replaceable, the wallet will use an economical estimate by default, since the fee can be 'bumped' if the fee conditions change rapidly (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10589\">PR 10589</a>).</li>\n<li>Estimates can now be made for confirmation targets up to 1008 blocks (one week).</li>\n<li>More data on historical fee rates is stored, leading to more precise fee estimates.</li>\n<li>Transactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons are now taken into account by the fee estimation logic, leading to more accurate fee estimates.</li>\n<li>The fee estimation logic will make sure enough data has been gathered to return a meaningful estimate. If there is insufficient data, a fallback default fee is used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to fee estimate RPCs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>estimatefee</code> RPC is now deprecated in favor of using only <code>estimatesmartfee</code> (which is the implementation used by the GUI)</li>\n<li>The <code>estimatesmartfee</code> RPC interface has been changed (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10707\">PR 10707</a>):\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>nblocks</code> argument has been renamed to <code>conf_target</code> (to be consistent with other RPC methods).</li>\n<li>An <code>estimate_mode</code> argument has been added. This argument takes one of the following strings: <code>CONSERVATIVE</code>, <code>ECONOMICAL</code> or <code>UNSET</code> (which defaults to <code>CONSERVATIVE</code>).</li>\n<li>The RPC return object now contains an <code>errors</code> member, which returns errors encountered during processing.</li>\n<li>If Bitcoin Core has not been running for long enough and has not seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee estimation, an error will be returned (previously a value of -1 was used to indicate an error, which could be confused for a feerate).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A new <code>estimaterawfee</code> RPC is added to provide raw fee data. External clients can query and use this data in their own fee estimation logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Transaction index changes</h2>\n<p>The transaction index is now built separately from the main node procedure,<br />\nmeaning the <code>-txindex</code> flag can be toggled without a full reindex. If omnicored<br />\nis run with <code>-txindex</code> on a node that is already partially or fully synced<br />\nwithout one, the transaction index will be built in the background and become<br />\navailable once caught up. When switching from running <code>-txindex</code> to running<br />\nwithout the flag, the transaction index database will <em>not</em> be deleted<br />\nautomatically, meaning it could be turned back on at a later time without a full<br />\nresync.</p>\n<p>However, please note, Omni Core requires an enabled transaction index!</p>\n<p>This change also has the effect that certain RPCs may not be available, until the<br />\ntransaction index was fully built.</p>\n<h2><code>rpcallowip</code> option changes</h2>\n<p>The <code>rpcallowip</code> option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces.  Instead, the <code>rpcbind</code> parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration.  If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like  Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. <code>docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332</code> (this is an extra <code>:8332</code> over the normal Docker port specification).</p>\n<h2><code>label</code> and <code>account</code> APIs for wallet</h2>\n<p>A new 'label' API has been introduced for the wallet. This is intended as a<br />\nreplacement for the deprecated 'account' API. The 'account' has been removed.</p>\n<p>The label RPC methods mirror the account functionality, with the following functional differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Labels can be set on any address, not just receiving addresses. This functionality was previously only available through the GUI.</li>\n<li>Labels can be deleted by reassigning all addresses using the <code>setlabel</code> RPC method.</li>\n<li>There isn't support for sending transactions <em>from</em> a label, or for determining which label a transaction was sent from.</li>\n<li>Labels do not have a balance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the changes to RPC methods:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Deprecated Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">New Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressinfo</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressinfo</code> returns a JSON object with address information instead of just the name of the account as a string.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaccountaddress</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">n/a</td>\n<td align=\"left\">There is no replacement for <code>getaccountaddress</code> since labels do not have an associated receive address.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressesbyaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressesbylabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressesbylabel</code> returns a json object with the addresses as keys, instead of a list of strings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getreceivedbyaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getreceivedbylabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>no change in behavior</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listaccounts</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listlabels</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listlabels</code> does not return a balance or accept <code>minconf</code> and <code>watchonly</code> arguments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listreceivedbyaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listreceivedbylabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Both methods return new <code>label</code> fields, along with <code>account</code> fields for backward compatibility.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>move</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">n/a</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>no replacement</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>sendfrom</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">n/a</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>no replacement</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>setaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>setlabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Both methods now: <ul><li>allow assigning labels to any address, instead of raising an error if the address is not receiving address.</li><li>delete the previous label associated with an address when the final address using that label is reassigned to a different label, instead of making an implicit <code>getaccountaddress</code> call to ensure the previous label still has a receiving address.</li></ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Changed Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>addmultisigaddress</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Renamed <code>account</code> named parameter to <code>label</code>.

When switching to Omni Core, it may be necessary to reprocess Omni Layer transactions.</p>\n<h1>Imported changes and notes</h1>\n<h2>Upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.18.1</h2>\n<p>The underlying base of Omni Core was upgraded from Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 to Bitcoin Core 0.18.1.</p>\n<p>Please read the following release notes for further details very carefully:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.14.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.1.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.14.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.2.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.14.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.3.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.14.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.15.0.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.15.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.15.0.1.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.15.1.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.15.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.15.2.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.15.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.16.0.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.16.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.16.1.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.16.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.16.2.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.16.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.16.3.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.16.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.17.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.1.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.17.0.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.1.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.17.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.0/doc/release-notes.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.18.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.18.1/doc/release-notes.md\">Release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.18.1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Allow any token to be traded for Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>Right now the native distributed exchange of the Omni Layer protocol supports trading Omni and Test Omni for Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>With this version, any token can be traded and there are no longer any trading restrictions.</p>\n<p>Please note: this consensus change is not yet activated, but included in this release. An announcement will be made, when this feature is activated.</p>\n<h2>Omni specific user-agent</h2>\n<p>As per default, starting with this version, Omni Core will identify itself as <code>/Satoshi:0.18.1 (Omni:0.7.0)/</code>.</p>\n<p>With the configuration option <code>-omniuseragent=0</code> will hide the client as regular Bitcoin Core node.</p>\n<h2><code>getinfo</code> deprecated</h2>\n<p>The <code>getinfo</code> RPC has been deprecated. Each field in the RPC<br />\nhas been moved to another commands output with that command also giving<br />\nadditional information that <code>getinfo</code> did not provide. The following table<br />\nshows where each field has been moved to:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><code>getinfo</code> field</th>\n<th>Moved to</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"version\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"version\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"protocolversion\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"protocolversion\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"walletversion\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getwalletinfo()[\"walletversion\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"balance\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getwalletinfo()[\"balance\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"blocks\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getblockchaininfo()[\"blocks\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"timeoffset\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"timeoffset\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"connections\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"connections\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"proxy\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"networks\"][0][\"proxy\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"difficulty\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getblockchaininfo()[\"difficulty\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"testnet\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getblockchaininfo()[\"chain\"] == \"test\"</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"keypoololdest\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getwalletinfo()[\"keypoololdest\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"keypoolsize\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getwalletinfo()[\"keypoolsize\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"unlocked_until\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getwalletinfo()[\"unlocked_until\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"paytxfee\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getwalletinfo()[\"paytxfee\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"relayfee\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"relayfee\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\"errors\"</code></td>\n<td><code>getnetworkinfo()[\"warnings\"]</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Fee estimation improvements</h2>\n<p>Fee estimation has been significantly improved with Bitcoin Core 0.15, with more accurate fee estimates used by the wallet and a wider range of options for advanced users of the <code>estimatesmartfee</code> and <code>estimaterawfee</code> RPCs (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10199\">PR 10199</a>).</p>\n<h3>Changes to internal logic and wallet behavior</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Internally, estimates are now tracked on three different time horizons. This allows for longer targets and means estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.</li>\n<li>Estimates can now be <em>conservative</em> or <em>economical</em>. <em>Conservative</em> estimates use longer time horizons to produce an estimate which is less susceptible to rapid changes in fee conditions. <em>Economical</em> estimates use shorter time horizons and will be more affected by short-term changes in fee conditions. Economical estimates may be considerably lower during periods of low transaction activity (for example over weekends), but may result in transactions being unconfirmed if prevailing fees increase rapidly.</li>\n<li>By default, the wallet will use conservative fee estimates to increase the reliability of transactions being confirmed within the desired target. For transactions that are marked as replaceable, the wallet will use an economical estimate by default, since the fee can be 'bumped' if the fee conditions change rapidly (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10589\">PR 10589</a>).</li>\n<li>Estimates can now be made for confirmation targets up to 1008 blocks (one week).</li>\n<li>More data on historical fee rates is stored, leading to more precise fee estimates.</li>\n<li>Transactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons are now taken into account by the fee estimation logic, leading to more accurate fee estimates.</li>\n<li>The fee estimation logic will make sure enough data has been gathered to return a meaningful estimate. If there is insufficient data, a fallback default fee is used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to fee estimate RPCs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>estimatefee</code> RPC is now deprecated in favor of using only <code>estimatesmartfee</code> (which is the implementation used by the GUI)</li>\n<li>The <code>estimatesmartfee</code> RPC interface has been changed (See <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10707\">PR 10707</a>):\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>nblocks</code> argument has been renamed to <code>conf_target</code> (to be consistent with other RPC methods).</li>\n<li>An <code>estimate_mode</code> argument has been added. This argument takes one of the following strings: <code>CONSERVATIVE</code>, <code>ECONOMICAL</code> or <code>UNSET</code> (which defaults to <code>CONSERVATIVE</code>).</li>\n<li>The RPC return object now contains an <code>errors</code> member, which returns errors encountered during processing.</li>\n<li>If Bitcoin Core has not been running for long enough and has not seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee estimation, an error will be returned (previously a value of -1 was used to indicate an error, which could be confused for a feerate).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A new <code>estimaterawfee</code> RPC is added to provide raw fee data. External clients can query and use this data in their own fee estimation logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Transaction index changes</h2>\n<p>The transaction index is now built separately from the main node procedure,<br />\nmeaning the <code>-txindex</code> flag can be toggled without a full reindex. If omnicored<br />\nis run with <code>-txindex</code> on a node that is already partially or fully synced<br />\nwithout one, the transaction index will be built in the background and become<br />\navailable once caught up. When switching from running <code>-txindex</code> to running<br />\nwithout the flag, the transaction index database will <em>not</em> be deleted<br />\nautomatically, meaning it could be turned back on at a later time without a full<br />\nresync.</p>\n<p>However, please note, Omni Core requires an enabled transaction index!</p>\n<p>This change also has the effect that certain RPCs may not be available, until the<br />\ntransaction index was fully built.</p>\n<h2><code>rpcallowip</code> option changes</h2>\n<p>The <code>rpcallowip</code> option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces.  Instead, the <code>rpcbind</code> parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration.  If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like  Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. <code>docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332</code> (this is an extra <code>:8332</code> over the normal Docker port specification).</p>\n<h2><code>label</code> and <code>account</code> APIs for wallet</h2>\n<p>A new 'label' API has been introduced for the wallet. This is intended as a<br />\nreplacement for the deprecated 'account' API. The 'account' has been removed.</p>\n<p>The label RPC methods mirror the account functionality, with the following functional differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Labels can be set on any address, not just receiving addresses. This functionality was previously only available through the GUI.</li>\n<li>Labels can be deleted by reassigning all addresses using the <code>setlabel</code> RPC method.</li>\n<li>There isn't support for sending transactions <em>from</em> a label, or for determining which label a transaction was sent from.</li>\n<li>Labels do not have a balance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the changes to RPC methods:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Deprecated Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">New Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressinfo</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressinfo</code> returns a JSON object with address information instead of just the name of the account as a string.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaccountaddress</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">n/a</td>\n<td align=\"left\">There is no replacement for <code>getaccountaddress</code> since labels do not have an associated receive address.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressesbyaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressesbylabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getaddressesbylabel</code> returns a json object with the addresses as keys, instead of a list of strings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getreceivedbyaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>getreceivedbylabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>no change in behavior</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listaccounts</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listlabels</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listlabels</code> does not return a balance or accept <code>minconf</code> and <code>watchonly</code> arguments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listreceivedbyaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>listreceivedbylabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Both methods return new <code>label</code> fields, along with <code>account</code> fields for backward compatibility.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>move</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">n/a</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>no replacement</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>sendfrom</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">n/a</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><em>no replacement</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>setaccount</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>setlabel</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Both methods now: <ul><li>allow assigning labels to any address, instead of raising an error if the address is not receiving address.</li><li>delete the previous label associated with an address when the final address using that label is reassigned to a different label, instead of making an implicit <code>getaccountaddress</code> call to ensure the previous label still has a receiving address.</li></ul></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Changed Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>addmultisigaddress</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Renamed <code>account</code> named parameter to <code>label</code>.
